## About Me

My name is Qian Qiao (乔谦). I am currently a master's student at Soochow University, supervised by [Jiaqing Fan](https://scst.suda.edu.cn/4c/a2/c11250a543906/page.htm) and [Fanzhang Li](https://scst.suda.edu.cn/0e/e0/c11250a528096/page.htm). My research focuses on several areas, including multimodal understanding, image generation, text spotting and few-shot learning, and **I have 4 years of experience in blockchain technology and investment**. **And now I have a strong interest in motion generation now and am looking for collaborators!**

<i style="color:#e74d3c">I will join [Weizhong Zhang](https://weizhonz.github.io/)'s team as a research assistant next year.</i>
