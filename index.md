## About Me

My name is Qian Qiao (乔谦). I am currently a researcher at Soul AILab. I received my Master's degree from Soochow University in July 2025, supervised by Professors [Fanzhang Li](https://scst.suda.edu.cn/0e/e0/c11250a528096/page.htm). My previous research focused on multimodal understanding, image generation, text spotting, and few-shot learning. Additionally, I have four years of experience in blockchain technology and investment. **Currently, my primary research interests are real-time video generation and dLLMs, and I am actively seeking collaborators in these fields!**

<!-- <i style="color:#e74d3c">I will join [Weizhong Zhang](https://weizhonz.github.io/)'s team as a research assistant next year.</i>   -->

<!-- I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position or **research assistant (remote)** in 2025 Fall. Feel free to contact me if you are interested! -->
